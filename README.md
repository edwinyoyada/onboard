### What you need to do (part I):

1. Install Git

2. Clone this repo

3. Create a new branch called `develop` and push it to github

### What you need to do (part II):

1. Install NodeJS and NPM (you can use the LTS or the newest one)

2. Install MySQL

### Optional:

1. Install Docker (tell me if you've done this)


### Update I:

#### Please finish this task one by one. You can separate each questions to a branch.

##### Basic NodeJS tasks
1. Create a server which listens to port 8080. Send `Hello World` response.
2. From no 1, put "World" as a query parameter in the URL and write it as response. So your url will be: `localhost:8080/World` and the response should be `Hello World`.
3. From no 2, put your name as a query string in the URL and write it as response. So your url will be: `localhost:8080?name=Kyle` and the response should be `Hello Kyle`.
4. From no 3, write the response to a file (eg. file.txt)
